# text-corrector-with-NLP

# Objective this project
  The objective of this project is to make a spell checker using NLP
  Two versions were made:
  ###V1: The first version was made a corrector that solves simpler errors. Although it fails to fix grotesque errors, in our mass of tests it performed better in most cases.
  ###V2: The second version solves more complex cases, which many times even we (humans) would not be able to understand a word, but in our test mass it objects to an overall result lower than the first version.
